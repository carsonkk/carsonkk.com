While the blockchain instances by default would be run internally by the platform's owner, they have the option of asking the community for support in exchange for incentives on the platform. For instance, imagine a web application that costs some small monthly fee to use, in exchange for both access to the platform and a guarantee of the privacy of your information. Traditionally, this monthly fee would then be put towards the hosting of the website as well as the costs of the storage and bandwidth of serving the users' data. Instead, a user could agree to host some portion of a blockchain replica, likely for one of the subcommunities they care about, in place of a monthly fee. Alternatively, the site could be free to all, but those that contribute to serving some of the bandwidth would receive additional perks. \"Gig-economy website hosting\" schemes such as this become viable given the semantics of storing the data through multiple sharded/replicated blockchain instances, which are forced to confirm the validity of their contents against one another."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{"id":"afterword"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#afterword","aria-hidden":true,"class":"anchor"},"children":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]},{"type":"text","value":"Afterword"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When we conceived the idea for this project, Bitcoin was coming off it's major 2017/2018 peak and everyone and their mother was on about blockchain.

This was our attempt to both better understand the underlying implementation of a blockchain, as well as have some fun with our own needlessly-blockchained invention.

Whether it be through users' helping host the website, serve the data, or administer it in some other manner, its a fun concept that builds a sense of community on the userbase. There are a couple examples of sites like this out there (beyond just having a \"donate to keep the site alive\" button), but often the system by which users contribute to the site's functionality seems to bog down the actual experience of using the website. It would be interesting to see the concept expanded further in some form or another."}]}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":16,"column":1082,"offset":3471}}}}
