While the blockchain instances by default would be run internally by the platform's owner, they have the option of asking the community for support in exchange for incentives on the platform. For instance, imagine a web application that costs some small monthly fee to use, in exchange for both access to the platform and a guarantee of the privacy of your information. Traditionally, this monthly fee would then be put towards the hosting of the website as well as the costs of the storage and bandwidth of serving the users' data. Instead, a user could agree to host some portion of a blockchain replica, likely for one of the subcommunities they care about, in place of a monthly fee. Alternatively, the site could be free to all, but those that contribute to serving some of the bandwidth would receive additional perks. \"Gig-economy website hosting\" schemes such as this become viable given the semantics of storing the data through multiple sharded/replicated blockchain instances, which are forced to confirm the validity of their contents against one another.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1216},"end":{"line":12,"column":1163,"offset":2378},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1216},"end":{"line":12,"column":1163,"offset":2378},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#afterword","title":null,"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-hidden":true,"class":"anchor"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Afterword","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":4,"offset":2383},"end":{"line":14,"column":13,"offset":2392},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":2380},"end":{"line":14,"column":13,"offset":2392},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"afterword","htmlAttributes":{"id":"afterword"},"hProperties":{"id":"afterword"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"When we conceived the idea for this project, Bitcoin was coming off it's major 2017/2018 peak and everyone and their mother was on about blockchain.
