Such infrastucure, often refferred to as \"edge clouds\", represents a relatively new branch of cloud computing which attempts to co-locate computational resources with the clusters of IoT devices it supports. Edge clouds face many additional challenges compared to their data center-based counterparts, including a severely restricted pool of hardware resources, and in some cases, operating in remote and/or inhospitable environments. Facing such conditions, a single failure within an edge cloud can take nontrivial proportions of the cloud \"offline\", with the delay before manual human servicing brings the cloud back to its original state being days, weeks, or even months."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Mandrake Coordinator (MC) is a software system designed to provide resource management and reprovisioning facilities to edge clouds. The MC provisions virtual machines (VMs) within a given cluster for some user application(s) to use. When a failure, or conversely a recovery, occurs, the MC detects this and reprovisions the VMs running on the cloud while maintaining a mapping of how each host and VM are related. It exposes this mapping through a set of APIs to services running within the VM, enabling them to make more informed decisions about data replication and failover by breaking the \"traditional cloud model\" of abstraction. This in turn significantly increases the availability and fault tolerance of virtualized user applications."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This project was a joint effort with Markus Mock, Rich Wolski and Chandra Krintz responsible for research advisement/assistance, John Thomason responsible for the Mandrake Application Orchestrator (MAO), and myself responsible for the Mandrake Cluster Manager (MCM)"}]}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/mandrake"},"frontmatter":{"banner":null,"logo":null,"title":"Mandrake","description":"Edge clouds","created":"2018-01-01","updated":"2018-01-01","feature":null,"draft":null,"tags":["Mandrake"],"github":null,"website":null,"allowCropping":null,"transparentLogo":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/mandrake","pointer":"/mandrake/"}}
