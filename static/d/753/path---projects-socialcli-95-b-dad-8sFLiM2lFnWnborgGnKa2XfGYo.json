The interface is all done via the command line where you (the sole administrator) have the power to create and delete users, posts, and comments as necessary. It also includes some built-int functionality to generate a pseudo-random initial set of users, which then populates all of the simulation's data structure instances and makes for a much more interesting testing environment when invoking traversal/deletion algorithms."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/socialcli"},"frontmatter":{"banner":null,"logo":null,"title":"socialcli","description":"CLI-based social networking platform/simulator","created":"2018-11-06","updated":"2019-09-30","feature":null,"draft":null,"tags":["C Plus Plus","Data Structures","Algorithms","Network Graphs","CLI"],"github":null,"website":null,"allowCropping":null,"transparentLogo":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/socialcli","pointer":"/socialcli/"}}
