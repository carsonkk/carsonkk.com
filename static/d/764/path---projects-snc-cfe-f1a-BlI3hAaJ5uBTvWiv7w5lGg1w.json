This was originally a project for a class on networking to get some initial exposure/experience with the C socket libraries typically used with Linux.

It can be ran as either a server or a client with the same semantics for establishing and tearing down communications between the two per netcat's documentation."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/snc"},"frontmatter":{"banner":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAl0lEQVQY042QaQ6CMBCFexE3EApdaSkQjfe/1mOmBEWjxB9f52WWN5MKf3tAhoTK9bi6iMJ0uGj/pLQBlaeajW95ptBLb55RHqfWQtjxDkPU3YDaJ4opG7DmmM1o0apX2KQ04RXJ/NgYCH7MsJjy4Fk5HKTOxT245xuCN6h+gqQLWe81b/m1SPAftHFCE8Zs+M912ys/czOLzJO1fvcJcAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":4,"src":"/static/1cf2bf3b6e18bd0a0468d3e817efb860/d4f11/netcat.png","srcSet":"/static/1cf2bf3b6e18bd0a0468d3e817efb860/76268/netcat.png 640w,\n/static/1cf2bf3b6e18bd0a0468d3e817efb860/fb5f3/netcat.png 1280w,\n/static/1cf2bf3b6e18bd0a0468d3e817efb860/d4f11/netcat.png 2560w","sizes":"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"}}},"logo":null,"title":"snc","description":"A simplified implementation of the netcat utility","created":"2018-11-06","updated":"2019-09-06","feature":null,"draft":null,"tags":["C","Networking","Linux","Utility"],"github":"carsonkk/snc","website":null,"allowCropping":null,"transparentLogo":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/snc","pointer":"/snc/"}}
