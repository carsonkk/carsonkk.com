His fondness of cars, particularly the classic era of muscle sports cars, eventually caught up to me, and when it came time to get my first car, we were both kicking around the idea of picking up a classic and restoring it. I had always enjoyed working out in our family's garage on various projects with the wide variety of tools and materials my dad had on hand, and a project on the scale of a classic car restoration seemed like an exciting challenge to take on."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After spending a few months monitoring local craigslist, ebay, and car magazine listings, we found a pretty good deal on a 1973 Ford Mustang in decent condition. We had already went and checked out a number of different classic cars at shows like the \"Pomona Swap Meet & Classic Car Show\" in southern California, and had narrowed down our choice to a few different cars based on two major factors- size and popularity. I'm pretty tall. Well into the 99.9th percentile for height in the US. As much as I love the body stylings of the '69-'70 Mustangs, the car itself is simply too small for me (hell, I can't even sit down in a '65 Mustang), whereas the '71-'73 models had noticeably more space to work with in the cabin. The other reason was the popularity among the classic car community of the first generation Mustangs. A big concern we had at the time was how difficult finding spare parts would be, should we need to replace anything that didn't have NOS or aftermarket parts readily available. We saw some pretty awesome cars during our search, but they were simply too esoteric of make/model, to the point where we could hardly find any stores selling parts for them online."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"beginning-the-process"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#beginning-the-process","ariaHidden":true,"className":["anchor"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"svg","properties":{"ariaHidden":"true","height":"16","version":"1.1","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","width":"16"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"path","properties":{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Beginning the Process"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Our initial plan was to just do a rebuild of the engine and any necessary repairs, but of course that quickly spiraled into a full-blown rebuild/restoration of the majority of the car.
