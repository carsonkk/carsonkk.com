Luber is basically a booking system, in which the car owners can post the availability of their car in terms of time, location, model, mileage, photo and price. In turn, users can search according to these parameters and the service will find the best match for both sides. We believe this model of short-term vehicle loans would be much more conducive to a userbase that plans to travel far distances, go on road trips, or need a car on a semi-regular basis."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"motivation"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#motivation","ariaHidden":true,"className":["anchor"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"svg","properties":{"ariaHidden":"true","height":"16","version":"1.1","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","width":"16"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"path","properties":{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"},"children":[]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Motivation"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Beyond the concept of this demonstration application, this project was meant to serve as a learning experience for building a web application from scratch using Ruby on Rails as the basis for the project. To make the project more interesting in terms of its complexities, we fully designed/implemented the frontend interface, added a number of different ways to view data about a car loan (user transaction), dynamically rendered information differently depending on if the user was the car owner, the car loaner, a website administrator, or just a guest on the website, and so on. We deployed the site using Amazon EC2's Elastic Beanstalk and ran load tests against it using Tsung to benchmark how our caching methods would help performance during periods of user (and in response resource) scaling."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This project was a joint effort between Justin Pearson, Michael Zhang, Sammy Guo, Sujaya Maiyya, and myself"}]}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/luber"},"frontmatter":{"banner":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":3.5,"src":"/static/aa39d0e299c23514dcf2c3340c23b114/92396/luber-logo-lg.png","srcSet":"/static/aa39d0e299c23514dcf2c3340c23b114/94aca/luber-logo-lg.png 640w,\n/static/aa39d0e299c23514dcf2c3340c23b114/e6f8d/luber-logo-lg.png 1280w,\n/static/aa39d0e299c23514dcf2c3340c23b114/92396/luber-logo-lg.png 2100w","sizes":"(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px"}}},"logo":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/static/47c76ce41c0844ce957c1f7f3f972b42/506cb/favicon.png","srcSet":"/static/47c76ce41c0844ce957c1f7f3f972b42/506cb/favicon.png 1x,\n/static/47c76ce41c0844ce957c1f7f3f972b42/4987e/favicon.png 1.5x,\n/static/47c76ce41c0844ce957c1f7f3f972b42/5f47c/favicon.png 2x"}}},"title":"Luber","description":"A ridesharing web application designed for scalability","created":"2018-10-11","updated":"2019-09-30","feature":true,"draft":null,"tags":["Ruby","Rails","Web Application","AWS","Scalability"],"github":"carsonkk/Luber","website":"luber-services.herokuapp.com","allowCropping":false,"transparentLogo":true}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/luber","pointer":"/luber/"}}
