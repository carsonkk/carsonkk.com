Using Unity as the game engine and the Vuforia AR library, we were able to get a single player version of the game working, however as we began adding the local multiplayer, we began to learn about a number of networking pitfalls that came with Unit's networking library at the time. The library was in a period of transition and much of the documentation was outdated or too obfuscated for us to understand.

It ended up being more of a learning experience than anything else, particularly for the importance of researching libraries ahead of time enough to identify major issues that can be avoided by simply using a different library."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This project was a joint effort between Jonathan Young and myself"}]}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/board"},"frontmatter":{"banner":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.1333333333333333,"src":"/static/d2d341c8a77597a62e2aabd67cc39141/d4f11/checkers.png","srcSet":"/static/d2d341c8a77597a62e2aabd67cc39141/76268/checkers.png 640w,\n/static/d2d341c8a77597a62e2aabd67cc39141/fb5f3/checkers.png 1280w,\n/static/d2d341c8a77597a62e2aabd67cc39141/d4f11/checkers.png 2560w","sizes":"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"}}},"logo":null,"title":"boARd","description":"Augmented reality Android application for local multiplayer board games","created":"2018-01-01","updated":"2018-01-01","feature":null,"draft":null,"tags":["Augmented Reality","AR","Android","Mobile Application","Game Development","Java","C Sharp","Unity","Vuforia"],"github":"carsonkk/boARd","website":null,"allowCropping":null,"transparentLogo":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/board","pointer":"/board/"}}
