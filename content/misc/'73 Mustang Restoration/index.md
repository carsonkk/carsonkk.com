## Picking a Car

As a kid, my dad and I would occasionally go check out local classic car shows. His fondness of cars, particularly the classic era of muscle sports cars, eventually caught up to me, and when it came time to get my first car, we were both kicking around the idea of picking up a classic and restoring it. I had always enjoyed working out in our family's garage on various projects with the wide variety of tools and materials my dad had on hand, and a project on the scale of a classic car restoration seemed like an exciting challenge to take on.

After spending a few months monitoring local craigslist, ebay, and car magazine listings, we found a pretty good deal on a 1973 Ford Mustang in decent condition. We had already went and checked out a number of different classic cars at shows like the "Pomona Swap Meet & Classic Car Show" in southern California, and had narrowed down our choice to a few different cars based on two major factors- size and popularity. I'm pretty tall. Well into the 99.9th percentile for height in the US. As much as I love the body stylings of the '69-'70 Mustangs, the car itself is simply too small for me (hell, I can't even sit down in a '65 Mustang), whereas the '71-'73 models had noticeably more space to work with in the cabin. The other reason was the popularity among the classic car community of the first generation Mustangs. A big concern we had at the time was how difficult finding spare parts would be, should we need to replace anything that didn't have NOS or aftermarket parts readily available. We saw some pretty awesome cars during our search, but they were simply too esoteric of make/model, to the point where we could hardly find any stores selling parts for them online.

## Beginning the Process

Our initial plan was to just do a rebuild of the engine and any necessary repairs, but of course that quickly spiraled into a full-blown rebuild/restoration of the majority of the car. The one thing we agreed *not* to do from the get-go was anything related to the paint, body, or glass. Seeing as this would be driven around in a high school parking lot, we had our expectations already setup for this thing to get bumped and scratched here and there by new drivers. Also, repairing existing scuffs in the body, installing new glass, and having a proper paint job done would run quite a bill, and we had enough to worry about as it was.

We began the rebuild process by pulling the old engine. We then stripped it down to the block, while also cleaning up the engine bay itself and stripping the cabin/trunk of the car down to the metal frame. We then rebuilt the engine back up using all new parts, while also soundproofing and restoring the interior. Eventually the car was put together enough to test out the new engine, however upon our initial startup, we discovered oil had gotten into the radiator- a sign that cracks had formed inside the original engine block between the passages for the oil and radiator fluid. We also found our valve covers to be poor quality and would need to replace them, but this issue of the oil and water mixing mean we'd have to get a new engine block and start from scratch.

## Trying Again

This time we picked up a crate engine from a company which specializes in restoring NOS engines/engine blocks that pass a series of tests to ensure durability and the absence of major flaws such as internal cracks in the block. Originally the engine was a V8 with 302 c.i, however we had the new crate engine block bored and bought a stroker kit to go along with it, bringing it up to about 355 c.i. With the new engine put together, the car was finally ready to be driven.

While not fully comprehensive, this list covers the majority of work that we did (and had done) to the car:

- Removed the old engine and transmission
- Cleaned, painted, and detailed the engine bay
- Building and installing a new engine (both bottom and top side) from a 302 V8 crate block that had been bored/stroked out to about 355 c.i.
