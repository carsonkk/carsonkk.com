## Getting Started Building

Below are all of the computers which I've helped pick out parts for, provided guidance on assembly, or assembled myself. I first got into building computers back in 2012 per some friends wanting me to play PC games with them, and have since helped many others do the same. Some resources that helped me along the way include:

- [r/buildapc](https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc) - Reddit's DIY PC building community. This community has grown substantially compared to when I began frequenting it and provides a massive amount of insight and resources between the general threads and the sidebar/wiki links. Regardless of what questions you have, chances are they've either already been answered there or someone there will have the answer for you.
- [PCPartPicker (PCPP)](https://pcpartpicker.com/list) - An awesome tool created by a r/BaPC user which allows you to make a list of parts for a build, compare prices from different vendors, and check for incompatibilities between parts. Any post to r/BaPC about a specific build typically includes a part list generated from this site.
- [Newegg's "How To" Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npGL2-pRXlU) - Newegg, an internet storefront for computer parts and electronics, has many videos on YouTube which provide informative, step-by-step instructions for building PC's. If you want to get an idea of what is involved in building a PC, that ~20 minute video will give you an excellent summary. If you intend to actually build one, check out their more slow-paced, multi-part series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIF43-0mDk4) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zAdwedmj1M), which go into much more detail.
- [Newegg Product Reviews](https://www.newegg.com) - While there are many websites you can purchase parts from, often at better prices than what Newegg offers, what Newegg does provides is an excellent filtering system for comparing parts- beyond what PCPP can do. Additionally, since many other DIY PC builders use the site as well, there's a substantial amount of user reviews which can help give insight into issues that may not have been obvious otherwise.

There are a number of forums, subreddits, youtube channels, and other websites which provide additional guidance, however these should be enough to get anyone started. Building a computer can be substantially cheaper than buying a pre-built, and is much easier than most people assume. The best comparison I've been able to draw to it would be building a set of Legos; the Legos are just much more expensive.
