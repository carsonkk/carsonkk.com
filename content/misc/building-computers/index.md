Below are all of the computers which I've helped pick out parts for, provided guidance on assembly, or assembled myself. I first got into building computers back in 2012 per some friends wanting me to play PC games with them, and have since helped others do the same. Some major resources that helped me along the way include:

- [r/buildapc](https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc) - Reddit's DIY PC building community. This community has grown substantially compared to when I began frequenting it and provides a massive amount of insight and resources between the general threads and the sidebar/wiki links.
- [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list) - An awesome utility/tool created by a r/BaPC user which allows you to make a list of parts for a build, compare prices, and check for incompatibilities between parts. Any post to r/BaPC typically includes a part list from this site.
- [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com) - While there are many websites you can purchase parts from, often at better prices than what Newegg offers, what Newegg does provides is an excellent filtering system for comparing parts- beyond what PCPP can do. Additionally, since many others use the site as well, there's a substantial amount of user reviews which can help give insight into issues that may not have been obvious otherwise.

There are many subreddits, youtube channels, and websites which provide additional guidance, however these should be enough to get anyone started. Building a computer can be substantially cheaper than buying a pre-built, and is much easier than many people may think. The best comparison I've been able to draw to it would be building a set of Legos; the Legos are just much more expensive.
