During my third year of college, the house I moved into with my friends needed some sort of wall art for a large empty wall in our dining room- I built this for that purpose.

It uses a thick plywood baseboard with the end pieces from wooden wine boxes layered on top to form a sort of collage of various wineries. There are five different shades of wood stain used to give the wood a nicer finish and add some contrast/depth to the design.
