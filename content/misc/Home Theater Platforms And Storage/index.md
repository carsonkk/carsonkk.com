During my third year of college, the house my friends and I moved into had a long, narrow layout, which resulted in the living room being an odd shape without much space for seating. As a solution to this, I built a pair of platforms for a second couch to sit on top of, as well as a pair of storage units to help elevate the audio system's rear tower speakers. 

The platforms themselves were carpeted and the storage units were lined with felt, with two cup holders added to each one. The area under the platforms served as additional storage space.

For the full build log, check out [this article](/articles/double-decker-couch).
