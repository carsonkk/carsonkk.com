## Humble Beginnings

CSG, or Combinational Sensing Glove, was a 2nd-year college project in which teams of two students would design anything they wanted around an Arduino board. The idea behind CSG was to design a glove with multiple arrays of sensors integrated into the material. By processing the information generated by each sensor both independently as well as across multiple groupings through [sensor fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion), we would be able to accurately model a human hand in 3D space. The "model" would include the yaw, pitch, and roll of the hand itself, the amount of total "flex" of each finger, and detection of "touch" between two or more fingers. Finally, we included some additional minor features for ease of control including an on/off switch, reset switch, four tactile buttons, and a set of corresponding indicator LEDs. This would later become the basis for my team's Senior Capstone Project, [Gestur](/projects/gestur).
