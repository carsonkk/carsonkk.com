## HCI & Sensor Fusion

CSG, or Combinational Sensing Glove, was a submition in a 2nd-year college project course in which teams of two students would design anything they wanted around an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board. The idea behind CSG was to design a glove with multiple arrays of sensors integrated into the material. By processing the information generated by each sensor both independently as well as across multiple groupings through [sensor fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion), we would be able to accurately model a human hand in 3D space. The "model" would include the yaw, pitch, and roll of the hand itself, the amount of total "flex" of each finger, and detection of "touch" between two or more fingers. Finally, we included some additional minor features for ease of control including an on/off switch, reset switch, four tactile buttons, and a set of corresponding indicator LEDs spread across a custom shield for the Arduino.

Below are some pictures of the finished glove, as well as a project poster. This project would later become the basis for my Senior Capstone Project, [Gestur](/projects/gestur).

Top Side View. Each finger has a flex sensor along its length, a 6DOF IMU is secured to the back of the hand, and an Arduino Due with a custom shield is attached to the forearm.

Bottom View. Each finger has conductive cloth sewed to the tip to add single a multi-touch detection between fingers.
