## Consolidation

Between my programming projects, DIY projects, and all of the interesting (and not so interesting) issues I've encountered along the way working on them, I wanted somewhere to organize my findings and make it easier to share with others. I also wanted to get some firsthand experience with some of the latest (at the time of initial creation) libraries/frameworks in webdev like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and this website proved to be an excellent exercise to meet that end.

This website also turned out to be an engaging challenge in web design and UI/UX, which is by no means my strong suit. I've always enjoyed expressing my creativity through the projects I do, however systems projects don't have nearly the same amount of opportunities for visual/artistic creativity as projects involving web design. There's a number of little easter eggs hidden throughout the site such as glitchy text, multiple themes, and many others- see if you can find them all.
