# Consolidation

Between my programming projects, miscellaneous projects, and all of the interesting (and sometimes not so interesting) issues I've encountered with them along the way, I wanted somewhere to throw all of this stuff together and make it easier to share with others. I also wanted to get some firsthand experience with some of the latest (at the time of initial creation) libraries/frameworks in webdev like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and this website proved to be an excellent exercise to meet that end.
