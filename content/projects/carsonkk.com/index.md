## Consolidation

Between my programming projects, miscellaneous projects, and all of the interesting (and sometimes not so interesting) issues I encounter with them along the way, I needed somewhere to throw all of this stuff together and make it easier to share with others, and what better place than a portfolio site! I also wanted to understand all of the hype behind some of the latest (at the time of initial creation) libraries/frameworks in webdev like [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and this proved to be an excellent exercise to meet that end.
