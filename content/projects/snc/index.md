# Sockets in C

"snc", or "simplified netcat" is a minimal implementation of the netcat utility written in C. This was originally a project for a class on networking to get some initial exposure/experience with the C socket libraries typically used with Linux. It only implements the most core flags and was more a means to an end to learn the library calls than to actually build something significant/stable. It can be ran as either a server or a client with the same semantics for establishing and tearing down communications between the two per netcat's documentation.
