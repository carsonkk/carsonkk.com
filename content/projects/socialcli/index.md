## Data Structures & Social Media

**socialcli** is a simulated social network built primarily as an exercise in implementing compact data structures and devising efficient algorithms to traverse and operate on instances of said structures. The interface is all done via the command line where you (the sole administrator) have the power to create and delete users, posts, and comments as necessary. It also includes some built-int functionality to generate a pseudo-random initial set of users, which then populates all of the simulation's data structure instances and makes for a much more interesting testing environment when invoking traversal/deletion algorithms.
