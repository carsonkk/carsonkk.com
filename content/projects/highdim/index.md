# Gaussian Clustering

Highdim is a python utility for experimenting with and learning about gaussian clustering using the classical example of a unit sphere comprised of many points in some high-order dimensional space. It allows the user to specify parameters such as the number of points in the unit sphere, the number of dimensions the sphere is represented in, what dimensionality the sphere should be projected down to, and more. More information about the theoretical background for this can be found in Chapter 2 of [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf).
