# SB Hacks

SB Hacks is a student-run organization that manages UCSB's largest annual hackathon event. My team and I work on developing a dynamic website for the events we host. This includes frontend work using HTML/CSS/JS and backend work using Python/Django (2015) and Ruby/Rails (2016 onward). I also work on the design and maintenance of a Rails-based registration system and a PostgreSQL database.
