## Command Line Argument Parsing Made Easy

Sealarg is a software library written in C meant to provide a more modern API for handling command line arguments. In its current state, it acts as a wrapper around the `getopt` and `getopt_long` libraries, expanding greatly on their capabilities. It provides a simple inerface for registering an argument parsing handler, adding arguments, and parsing said arguments. It additionally generates a helper flag, automatically formating and pritning out a verbose description of the valid arguments for the program. For more information see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/carsonkk/Sealarg#getting-started) section of the repo.
