During my third year of college, I moved into a place with some friends that had a dining room with a long, empty wall and had nothing to decorate it with. While trying to come up with ideas for something to fill the space, I remembered my neighbor mentioning once that he had access to an assortment of wine boxes- wooden boxes used for shipping/storing bottles of wine. It seemed like a fun material to do some sort of woodworking project with, so I took that as the opportunity to finally build something out of them.

I began by disassembling each wine box, saving only the pieces with graphics on them and setting aside the rest for scrap.

Since the wood used for these boxes isn't that high of quality, I sanded down the edges and face of each piece enough to smooth out any splintering sections.

With the pieces prepped, I began by laying them out to take inventory of all the different sizes I had.

I wanted to do some sort of collage of the various pieces- something simple that would be thin while having a wide surface area to cover the wall. To that end, I tried to organize them in a way that gave some sense of depth and variance in the positioning of the pieces, while seperating out duplicate labels as much as possible. I kept the larger pieces on the back side and the smaller pieces more towards the front for a bit more structural integrity.

With a rough design put together, I took note of the position of the pieces and marked them each with a number 1-5, with each number corresponding to a different shade of wood stain. I figured using a gradient of different stains as opposed to just one would be a nice way to distract from the fact that there were duplicate pieces used.

Once all of the pieces had been stained I laid them back out according to the original design. On the very back I used a large 3/4" piece of plywood as a "baseboard" for the pieces to add some much needed stability. I then glued and screwed the initial layer of pieces to the baseboard, making sure any screws were positioned such that they'd be covered up by pieces closer to the front, ensuring a cleaner look.

From here I just continued to follow my initial design, placing and glueing pieces until everything was attached. Because it fans out both vertically and horizontally much further than the plywood baseboard, it ended up being a bit difficult to transport, but thankfully the bottom was reinforced well enough for it to rest on its bottom edge.

Lastly, I attached a heavy duty cable to the back so it could actually hang on a wall. And here it is on said wall!

All in all it was a pretty simple, straightforward project. Not much was needed in the way of tools or even woodworking for that matter- just a lot of planning and prepping.
