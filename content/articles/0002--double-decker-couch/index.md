During my third year of college I moved into a house with some friends that had a long, narrow floorplan. In particular, the living room was such that the couch would end up being pretty far away from the TV. Since we had so much extra space, we decided having a double decker couch setup would be perfect to take advantage of the house's layout.

To that end, I designed a simple box-shaped frame to be built out of 2x4's. I broke the platform into two smaller platforms to make transporting them, as well as getting them through the front door, much more manageable.

This is the initial structure of the platform, without the supporting pieces.

And here are both platforms side-by-side with their diagonal support pieces added on.

To make them a bit more comfortable to step on, I added a plywood top piece which carpet could then be attached to.

With this the platforms were done, however there was another issue that the platforms didn't account for. Our home theater system had tower speakers in the back as well (because hey why not), but this meant that the speakers would be pointed straight into the rear couch, rather than elevated above the couch. To fix this, I also designed some "containers" which would *just* fit on either side of the rear couch and provide storage, cup holders, and some much needed elevation for the speakers.

Here they are having their frames assembled.

And here's a shot of one of the containers almost completely assembled.

As a finishing touch, I decided to cover them in felt, cutting a single piece of felt which would line the entire thing inside and out.

To attach the felt, I used a few cans of spray-on project glue designed for both wood and fabrics.

Towards the very end, I added on a little "guard" piece of wood to each containers to prevent the cup holders from being bumped around.

I then cut some holes in the felt for the cup holders and glued them in. Overall the containers came out looking pretty clean. I think a big part of that was using a single piece of felt rather than cutting individual pieces for each face; there weren't nearly as many seams.

Here the two platforms are installed into the living room.

And finally some couches for a theater style double decker seating area!

From this angle you can see the issue the containers were built to solve- without the containers, the tower speakers face directly into the couch, rather than higher up in the air.

The width of the containers was designed around the couch such that they would fit snugly between the couch and the wall on either side.
